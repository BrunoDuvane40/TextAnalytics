###### ALL THE WAY

Just a sentence to be able to see how some examples work. **Be bold**

__Be bold twice but differently__

_Be Italic my fellow_

*Be Italic twice but differently*

Now for quote blocks:

Martin Luther said 

> "I have a dream", a **bold dream**

Can you imagine, being **_Italic Bold_**

~~Scratch that though~~
